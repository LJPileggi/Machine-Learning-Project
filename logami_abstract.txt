We developed a Multilayer Perceptron, that we trained using backpropagation
on both the MONK and MLCUP datasets. We explored several configurations of
architectures and hyperparameters through grid search, selecting the best configu-
ration through multiple initialisation and 4-fold cross validation respectively. The
performances were then assessed on their respective test sets.
