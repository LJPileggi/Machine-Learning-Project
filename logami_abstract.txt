The project we created is a series of python scripts that allowed us to define and train Neural Networks. After a series of nested grid searches and confrontations using the mean and variance from a k-fold cross validation, we found a model that could be used to predict the MLCUP dataset in the most precise way. 3 layers of 15 tanh units, and a linear final layer with 2 nodes. a small learning rate at 0.05, with an exponential decay of 50. A momentum of 0.8, and for regularization, 1e-5 is the value the used lambda
